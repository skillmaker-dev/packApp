- Please note that the scenes have the same name as their controller class With **Controller** as a suffix **nouvelleCommande.fxml** -> **NouvelleCommandeController.java**.
- inside every scene there is a *Back* button and also there is some buttons like : **chercher** **Enregistrer** ...

- We are going to use **SQLite** database.

- We are going to add some features in upcoming versions: PDF export, Qr code generator...
