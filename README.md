- Please note that the scenes have the same name as their controller class With **Controller** as a suffix **chercherCommande.fxml** -> **ChercherCommandeController.java**.
- inside every scene there is a *Back* button and also there is some buttons like : **chercher** **Enregistrer** ... their scenes files have the name of button before the original scene file name :  **ChercherClient.fxml** -> **chercher_chercherClient.fxml** .

- We are going to use **Mysql** database.
- We are going to use **TableView** to display products and orders ( each row contains labels ).

- We are going to add some features in upcoming versions: PDF export, Qr code generator... 

- Note that this is still not a complete application, only some scenes are made.

- **rootPage.fxml** is the login scene.
- **rootPageController.java** is the login scene controller

- Feel free to commit.
